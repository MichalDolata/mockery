# Mockery

It's still under development.
Everything is subject to change.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mockery, "~> 0.3.1"}
  ]
end
```

## Basic usage

```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.UserService do
    def users, do: []
  end
```

Prepare tested module:

```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.UserController do
    @service Mockery.of(MyApp.UserService)

    def index do
      @service.users()
    end
  end
```

Use mock in your tests:

```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.UserControllerTest do
    use ExUnit.Case, async: true
    import Mockery

    alias MyApp.UserController, as: Controller
    alias MyApp.UserService, as: Service

    describe "index" do
      test "not mocked" do
        assert Controller.index() == []
      end

      test "mocked" do
        mock(Service, :users, [:john, :donald])

        assert Controller.index() == [:john, :donald]
      end
    end
  end
```

## Global mock

Create helper module:

```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.TestUserService do
    use Mockery.Heritage,
      module: MyApp.UserService

    mock [users: 0] do
      [:user1, :user2, :user3]
    end
  end
```

Prepare tested module:

```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.UserController do
    @service Mockery.of(MyApp.UserService, by: MyApp.TestUserService)

    def index do
      @service.users()
    end
  end
```

## TODOS

- [x] basic functionality
- [x] setup CI
- [x] global mock (through Mockery.Heritage)
- [x] let it work without recompiling additional module after each change
- [x] let Mockery.of/2 work without :by option
- [ ] let global mock work with only function name (without arity)
- [ ] way to check if function was called
- [ ] docs
